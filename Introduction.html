        <p>I believe in the power of elegant minimalism in a world increasingly saturated with garish color. For this most of my time i play with color. My Imagination is power of innovation. 
        As an idea maker i made such solution for real life problem. Also want to exploration such kind of work for people. <br><br>
        Sometimes I write content to express my feelings; Sometimes design logo,animation to feel satisfaction in myself; Sometimes remove frustration by running code and increase critical thinking power.<br> <br>
        As developer I develop website from my site of interest and trying to solve people's suffering from my wesite. <br><br>
        At the time of my knowing, I do researching on that topic to gain the absolute knowledge and I love to do research on every topic.</p>
