          <p>I have passion in Art & Craft, Collection, Photography, Travelling and Helping others.<br><br>

As a designer I love to play ‚Å¨with art.By making handicraft Drawing,Painting,Sticking and Creating I pleased my brain and soul.I have a plan for kids to make their learning happy and artistic.<br><br>

"Swapnagalpa" is my favorite Art that I drew! I sat down to make my dream with a story with that pencil of Fabercastle or Color and that pad! Let's start all the stories inside the image inside my mind.<br>
Sometimes the inner emotion and sometimes a cartoon character.<br>
Get up on the pad of my dreams! Be that as it may, when I am very upset, when I am very happy, I cherish and love.
Who knows, maybe Painting is my greatest passion!<br><br>

Let me tell you a little story, I used to like to see very small colors like all the kids, maybe still! Then I used to cut different colored papers and make some of my favorite shapes.<br>
The weaving of flowers inside the mind is some new shape that can be seen in my eyes with my hands, living soul! I love to craft!It can be called a favorite Passion!<br><br>

Photography is a Passion not a carrer.
I hear a lot of people who take pictures and make the reality of life with pictures. But the reality is that it is very difficult; the lens of the camera does not catch the lens of the eyes.<br>
I don't know how successful I am, but I have been trying for a long time and I still do.<br>
Because that's my big Passion.<br><br>

And collection of anything like Glass Bottle,Different country Currency note collection are impulsive of my passion.<br><br>

By Travelling I want to collect story of mass people.And make some photostory by photography.Also helping crisis people to make them financial,mental and physical able.</p>
